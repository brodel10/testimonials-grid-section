## My process

Approach:
I started by structuring the page with semantic HTML, making it easy to understand and accessible. Each testimonial was designed as a separate card with user details, a summary, and a detailed experience. I used CSS Grid to create the overall layout, which gave me flexibility in arranging the cards, and Flexbox within the cards to keep everything aligned and spaced properly. I followed a mobile-first approach, using media queries to make the design adapt smoothly to larger screens. To make each card stand out while keeping a consistent look, I added unique styles and background elements.
